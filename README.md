Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

Project Overview
Credit card fraud is a major concern in the financial sector, as fraudulent transactions lead to significant financial losses and reduced customer trust. This project focuses on building a machine learning model that predicts whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent based on transaction-related features.
This project was developed with an emphasis on practical implementation, data analysis, handling imbalanced data, and model evaluation for real-world fraud detection scenarios.

Objective
To analyze credit card transaction data and predict credit card fraud (Yes / No) using machine learning techniques, helping financial institutions detect fraudulent activities in advance.

Dataset Information
Dataset Name: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Records: 284,807 transactions
Target Variable: Fraud (Yes / No)
The dataset contains anonymized transaction features generated using PCA, along with transaction amount and time. The data is highly imbalanced, with very few fraudulent transactions compared to legitimate ones.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
IDE: Google Colab
Libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Exploratory Data Analysis
Transaction amount vs fraud
Time-based transaction analysis
Class distribution visualization
Correlation heatmap

Results
Model Accuracy: ~99.2%
The model performs very well in identifying legitimate transactions while maintaining strong fraud detection capability. Due to data imbalance, additional metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were considered.

Key Insights
Credit card fraud data is highly imbalanced, with very few fraudulent transactions.
Feature scaling improves model performance and stability.
Accuracy alone is not sufficient for fraud detection.
Machine learning models can successfully detect hidden fraud patterns.
